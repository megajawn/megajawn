- 👋 Hi, I’m @megajawn
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of education and coding. I am a career math teacher looking to branch out.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CS 50 on edex.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that intersect with CS learning and mathematics learning for K-8 age groups.
- 📫 How to reach me DM me? I don't even know if that's a thing here yet but I'll figure it out.
